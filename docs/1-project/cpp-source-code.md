# C++ Source Code

The C++ source code was written by Raphael Riebl and stored on [github](https://github.com/riebl/sim0mqpp).

This implementation of Sim0MQ is motivated by the coupling between the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) simulator [Artery](https://github.com/riebl/artery) and [OpenTrafficSim](https://opentrafficsim.org/manual/).
Artery employs OMNeT++ as core for its discrete event simulation of the wireless network spanning vehicles, road side units and more.
Both, Artery and OMNeT++, are written in C++ for which no Sim0MQ library had been available before.
